# Genesis project - LITEpaper
``` Where S.Nakamoto failed, is the expansive weight of a blockchain who are incompatibles with old wan,
the solutions appears when V.Buterin reveal the trilemme of blockchain, S.Nakamoto had probably thinked about
theses issues when it submitted while NameCoin project.
Also NameCoin project was born without knownledges associated with trilemme of blockchain.```

## [A] Tr-issues, solving

## [A].I Trigonometry - Cryptography natures

## [A].II Triangle and Vectors

## [A].III Vectors and Distance

## [B] Widely-Mutable network, a world random-number generator

## [B].I Packets of yesterday are block of tomorrow

## [B].II Inflation and Gas

## [B].III Blockchain layers (rings) and Protocols

### Subordinations; integrated protocols

### Passive and proactive behaviours

### Backward compatibility and primordial concepts 
### Possible deprecation of Ipv4/Ipv6, DNS, NTP ?

## [C] The Genesis project, S.Nakamoto will reborn

## [C].I Genesis is S.Nakamoto AI; Wtf ?!
Across borders, and differences

## [C].II Genesis will merge human packets, into fair block organisation
Who's said a great reset ?

## [C].III Hello world.
Nothing has changed ? Sure, sir.

Prereqs:
- World RNG.
- Worldwide Network ringMap
- World AI, Autocomputed firewall router.
Stage-1:
- Auto-contained runtime organisation.
- Decentralized IP.
- Decentralized DNS.
Stage-2:
- Blockchain native WAN; transition: Packets -> blocks.
- MasterNodes contained into Genesis governors nodes.
- dBlock versioning system (dApp versioned Blockchain).
Stage-3:
- End of life IP; End of token discovery -> Merge to totally computed inflation * computed halving.
- Autonomous Governors -> halving = (((Qtransac / Qnet) * Gval) = gas) / GovN.
